# DevOps Documentation

## Introduction
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automate code integration from multiple contributors.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automate deployment of code to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure using code and automation tools.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Track application performance and system health.
- **Collaboration:** Foster communication between development and operations teams.

## DevOps Tools

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Workflow Example

1. Developer pushes code to repository.
2. CI server runs automated tests.
3. If tests pass, code is built and deployed to staging.
4. Automated deployment to production after approval.
5. Monitoring tools track performance and errors.

## Best Practices

- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Use version control for all code and configurations.
- Monitor systems proactively.
- Foster a culture of collaboration and feedback.
- Continuously improve processes.
